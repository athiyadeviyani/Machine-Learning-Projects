    "The Myers Briggs Type Indicator (or MBTI for short) is a personality type system that divides everyone into 16 distinct personality types across 4 axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introversion (I) – Extroversion (E)\n",
    "Intuition (N) – Sensing (S)\n",
    "Thinking (T) – Feeling (F)\n",
    "Judging (J) – Perceiving (P)\n",
    "So for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking and perceiving would be labelled an INTP in the MBTI system, and there are lots of personality based components that would model or describe this person’s preferences or behaviour based on the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one of, if not the, the most popular personality test in the world. It is used in businesses, online, for fun, for research and lots more. A simple google search reveals all of the different ways the test has been used over time. It’s safe to say that this test is still very relevant in the world in terms of its use."

Would really love to say that this project went they way I hoped but the model ended up classifying the same Myers-Briggs personality type to Trump and I... for real though? ðŸ˜±


## Interested?
- If you want to read through the code and the outputs quickly, head over to the [PDF](https://github.com/athiyadeviyani/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/TwitterMBTI/TwitterMBTI.pdf) or the [HTML](https://www.TwitterMBTI.glitch.me/) version of the Jupyter Notebook
- If you want to get your hands dirty and understand the inner workings of the code, make sure you install the following requirements, download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) (not included in this repository) and run the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/athiyadeviyani/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/TwitterMBTI/TwitterMBTI.ipynb)!
